PRCC SROC RMSE
they are calculated between SSIM and DMoS arrays (with results of the entire database) and they are already calculated in the dataset
Then do the same for each type of degradation separately (at first do it global 5 arrays together)
Then the improvement of SSIM
The teacher will choose an original image and a degraded image to calculate SSIM and SSIM'

Rapport Theory part where you explain SSIM and our improvement 
When putting the value table we comment it


first 
function to iterate each image by its ref and deg image (done)
extract dmos from the file
calculate ssim of each ref image with it multiple deg images , create a table of each deg folder
